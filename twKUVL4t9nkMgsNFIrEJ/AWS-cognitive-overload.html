      <span class="text-sm text-nowrap"><strong>Jeff</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; March 14, 2024</span>
    <p style="padding-top: 1em;">I started lifting up the rug, researching AWS pricing and server options late last week so I could start putting together some numbers, estimates and proposals for our new web server "cluster". Right out of the gate I was very overwhelmed by the large amount of choices, and the ambiguity of the entire AWS process. After getting nowhere fast, I realized the best way to figure things out was to get my hands dirty, spin up my own server and find the answers to our questions. </p>

<p style="padding-top: 1em;">AWS offers a 12 month free trial for a bare minimum "micro" server instance. A "micro" instance provides about enough RAM and bandwidth to run a micro-site or a blog... which is why I chose to use AWS to get our <strong>metricscenter.org</strong> "MVP" off the ground, up and running. Any additional AWS "micro" instances comes at a cost of about $0.0115/hr, which seemed like an acceptable/feasible option to play around for a couple hours, then shut it down and only see about a dime hit my credit card for my troubles. </p>

<p style="padding-top: 1em; font-size:2.5rem"><strong>Setting the stage</strong></p>

    <p style="padding-top: 1em;">After getting the new test instance up and running, things started to spiral almost immediately. The whole point of this exercise was to put AWS through a real life "grantee portal" scenario. The first task on my list was to add a database, which we are going to need to store our user data... at a minimum, username, password and an authentication token. AWS required that I setup an "RDS" (Relational Database Service) instance, which essentially is an entire suite of tools and services to run and manage a database... in my case a simple PostgreSQL database. It took about a full day of setting up security profiles and figuring out how to attach the database to my "test" instance. </p>

    <p style="padding-top: 1em;">After some hair pulling I found out that I needed to create a "VPC" (Virtual Private Cloud) which is basically a "virtual networking environment" to house all of my "services" under one roof... including my "test" compute cloud server instance, the database, and my S3 storage instance (which I have conveniently left out of this rant to spare you the details). The nice thing I would say about the "VPC" is that you only need to setup one security profile and one route table to control everything inside the VPC, as opposed to recreating separately for each instance or service that is used. </p>

    <p style="padding-top: 1em;">If I haven't lost you yet, you can see why I had to take a step back, reflect and face the tough decision... is AWS really the right monster for us to be using? I reached out to Ken Christensen and Philip Ventura (Computer Science and Cloud Computing professors at USF) to get their thoughts. Ken strongly suggested that we use Wordpress?? No comment is the nicest thing I can write as a response. Wordpress has a pretty large ecosystem and lots of plugins that could probably get us close to where we would like to be, but we lose all customization and the ability to scale since we're locked into using their "managed cloud". I tried to keep an open mind, but no thanks. </p>

    <p style="padding-top: 1em;">Over the years I've built several small business websites using Linode, Vercel, Heroku, and DigitalOcean... with DigitalOcean holding a significant lead in my books over the others in terms of pricing, accessibility and ease of use. Here's a run down of my findings for AWS vs DigitalOcean. </p>
    
      <div class="border-border md:border-l-4 md:pl-10" style="margin: 1em 1em 0;">
          <p style="font-style: italic;">"AWS is designed to cater to the IT needs of enterprises, which are vastly different from those of startups and SMBs. When you choose AWS for your startup or SMB, you are force-fitted to a cloud that was built for a large enterprise, resulting in complexity that you might not be equipped to handle. AWS’ cloud platform with more than 200 services, hundreds of instance types and numerous workflows makes your IT environment complex and cumbersome to maintain. The <strong>cognitive overload</strong> resulting from this complexity necessitates long hours of configuration and÷ management, along with additional training and certifications for your staff. Without a large IT and Devops team, this scale of technological complexity is a huge distraction for growth-focused businesses."<br>- Deepak (Medium article)</p>
      </div>

    <p style="padding-top: 1em;">I couldn't have said it better myself. </p>

    <p style="padding-top: 1em; font-size:2.5rem"><strong>What about cost?</strong></p>

    <p style="padding-top: 1em;">Next comes pricing. With a single AWS "micro" instance, the cost is pennies to run per month.</p>

      <div class="border-border md:border-l-4 md:pl-10" style="margin: 1em 1em 0;">
          <p>$0.0115 x ~750 hours in a month = $8.625/month... to be exact</p>
      </div>
    
    <p style="padding-top: 1em;">However, once you start adding any bells and whistles, database/storage, or start to scale and need to increase server size and bandwidth, the cost goes up exponentially... key word here being "bandwidth".</p>

    <p style="padding-top: 1em;">A "micro" server on AWS, without any storage can run around $50/month, based on ~100 users/day in bandwidth. With DigitalOcean that cost would be about $10/month... same specs. However, we can't even run a CMS (Content Management System) on an AWS "micro" instance... which only provides 1 GiB of memory. A "large" instance on AWS, 8 GiB memory, is fairly standard and runs at around $500/month with ~100 users/day in bandwidth. DigitalOcean on the other hand comes in at around $75/month. This is all due to the hidden bandwidth costs that AWS has conveniently hidden behind the curtain, which sneak up and bite you. </p>

    <p style="padding-top: 1em;">AWS offers a "savings plan" if you lock in for 1 or 3 years. However, you lock yourself in to a server "family" and if you need to scale, you essentially need to pay the flat rate for a new server instance. With their "savings plan" you basically say, I am going to only pay $0.25/hr/month for 3 years. If you scale or use more bandwidth, then you are on your own and start getting charged standard "on-demand" pricing.</p>

    <p style="padding-top: 1em;">For better or worse, DigitalOcean does not offer contract pricing. They are very set on their "Simple, predictable pricing -- Always know what you'll pay with monthly caps and flat pricing." The key benefit with them is including a substantial amount of storage and bandwidth on all their "CPU-Optimized" servers, or "droplets" as they call them. This made DigitalOcean a clear winner for me.</p>

    <p style="padding-top: 1em;">To put a pin in all this... yesterday I spun up a DigitalOcean "droplet", installed our CMS, which required attaching a database, and was up and running in about 4 hours. Soup to nuts. </p>
